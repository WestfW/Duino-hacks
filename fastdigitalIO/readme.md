# Fast Digital IO for Arduino

## Theory
### Why do we want digitalWriteFast() and digitalReadFast?
### Why are the Arduino funnction so slow?
### What are the limits of speed?

## Limitations - what do we lose by using digitalWriteFast()/etc?
## Other pieces of general strategy
### Constants
### Compiler Optimizations
### Fast Buses or address spaces
### Bit-processing peripherals

## Architecture Specific comments
### AVR
### ARM
### ARM Cortex M0
### ARM Cortex M3/M4
